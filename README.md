The Email Spam Classifier is a machine learning-powered application designed to distinguish between spam and legitimate emails. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this classifier analyzes the content of emails to identify patterns and features commonly associated with spam. The classifier leverages a trained model and vectorizer to process and categorize email text.

### Key Features:
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained model to accurately predict whether an email is spam or not.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Employs NLP techniques to analyze and interpret the text content of emails.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the app offers an intuitive and interactive interface for users to input email text and get instant classification results.
- **Real-Time Classification**: Provides immediate feedback on the nature of the email, helping users manage their inbox more effectively.

### Technical Details:
- **Vectorizer**: Transforms email text into numerical features that the model can understand.
- **Model**: A machine learning algorithm trained on a dataset of emails, capable of distinguishing spam from legitimate emails based on learned patterns.
- **Streamlit Framework**: Facilitates the creation of a seamless and interactive web application for email classification.

With this Email Spam Classifier, users can easily identify and filter out unwanted spam emails, ensuring a cleaner and more efficient email experience.
